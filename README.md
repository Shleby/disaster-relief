Cers is designed to help those affected by disaster. This app brings first responders and those who are affiliated with people involved in disasters together. We recognize that when you are in a disaster its easy to not be accounted for, so this gives a system that allows loved ones to reach out to first responders and put out missing person's requests as well as help get invovled with orginizations working to help support those who are affected.

## Tech used
###### Front End
- React: TypeScript & CSS
###### Back End
- MongoDB: Clusters, utilizing Mongo's Stitch App to connect the back end with the front end. We created http services in stitch that allowed us to have get and post requests running to and from our React app.

- Microsoft Azure: We used this to host it online and to also use their cloud services to store the database we created with MongoDB.
